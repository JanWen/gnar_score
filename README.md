ELO system enrichen by findings from machine learning models.

HOW TO TEST AN ELO SYSTEM

- elo system is not a predictive model, it is not supposed to predict failures or upsets, it is supposed to reflact them
- predictive power can still be used to verify basic functionality of an elo system
-

IDEA: Update elo not per game but per match with increasing importance acording to games in a match
win bo5 
boX are good numerical indicator of match importance since it's unlikely you'd want important titles decided by a small nr of matches
how do we make this so the code isnt shit :thinking_face:

CHANGELOG:

13/09/2023:
Implemented a basic elo system  based on games wins
14/09/2023
