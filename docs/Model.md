MODEL FOR LEAGUE game


EACH TIME STEP 1 MINUTE?
Probably Bad - too low resolution, or need to figure out the occurence of "team fights"/"skrimishes
where a lot of kills happen in 1 min intersperesed with nothing

summer roll to save from kill?
pog champ summer roll?

a kill temprorily increasing chance of follow up kills


Maybe:
Time step per MINUTE
each minute team can make a PLAY

1. Timestep for each minute
2. Both team roll for plays
3. Team that makes play rolls for objectives
4. On failure opposing team rolls for counter objectives
5. Playroll combined win gotten objectives and time steps can reult in winning plays
6. Play have a "cooldown" or temp penatly
7. Winning plays should increase chances

Teams with diff strategies?
Separate into game and team classes?
Maybe just team classes first?
Game speeds vary:
early slow
mid fast
late medium

pentalties need to be sin wave-ish

game time good indicator of skill
people say low skill players dont know "how to close out the game", however i believe it stems from the built in comback systems. a low-skilled player in a position where he is head and trying to close out the game is likely to make a mistake, which will be punished much harder then mistakes at other stages/games states. A high-skill player finding himself with a significant advantage will avoid losing the bounty and simply end the game.
